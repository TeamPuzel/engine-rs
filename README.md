# Engine
A Pico-8 inspired WebGL game engine with no depencencies.

Once the embedded mode is usable this project will move to Swift.
That version of the engine is much more developed and includes features like a UI framework,
but is currently impossible to port to the web due to the language's dependency on WASI.

I'd like to write it in Mojo but it will probably take at least half a year until the language has enough features.
I'll wait to see which of the languages will be usable sooner.

Currently a star rendering demo is implemented as an example.
